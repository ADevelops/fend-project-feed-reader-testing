# Udacity Project #4 - Feed Reader Testing 

## Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project concept is that the original developer of the application decided to move on to start their own company and I took over their role, and was left with an application with an incomplete [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suite.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What this project taught me?

I learnt how to use Jasmine, a behavior-driven develpmemnt framework for testing JavaScript code. I wrote a number of tests against a pre-existing application to test the underlying business logic of the application, as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
